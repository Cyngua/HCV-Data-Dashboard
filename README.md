# HCV-Data-Dashboard
BIS634 Fall 2023 Final Project - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Prediction and User Interface

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a virus that can cause damage and diseases in human livers (e.g., Hepatitis C). The aims of this project are to:
1. Explore a HCV dataset in UCI machine learning repository.
2. Propose an ML-based approach to predict HCV infection based on several critical lab testing results.
3. Design a web interface that allows users to explore the dataset and ML-model validation.
